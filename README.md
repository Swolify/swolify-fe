# Swolify


### Group Project

## Overview

Hate working out but love yelling bingo? Try Swolify! At Swolify, users play an Exercise Bingo game, selecting which forms of exercise they want to perform, and then Swolify randomly generates a number of exercises based on the difficulty setting selected by the user. The user then completes exercises one at a time, which complete randomized tiles on the Bingo board. The user then completes exercises until obtaining a Bingo.
